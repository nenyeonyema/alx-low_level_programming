# Makefile for building the school executable

# Rule: all
# The 'all' rule is the default target. 
# It specifies that 'school' is the target and 'main.c' is its dependency.
# When you run 'make all' or just 'make' without any target specified, it will build the 'school' executable.
all: school

# Rule to build the 'school' executable
school: main.c
	gcc main.c -o school

# Clean rule: 
# Use this rule to remove the generated executable and any other generated files.
clean:
	rm -f school
